## Object Model

```go
package main

import "time"

type Statistic struct {
	BuildId             string    `json:"build_id"`
	UserId              string    `json:"user_id"`
	TimeRequestReceived time.Time `json:"time_request_received"`
	TimeRequestBegan    time.Time `json:"time_request_began"`
	TimeRequestFinished time.Time `json:"time_request_finished"`
	BuildDeleted        bool      `json:"build_deleted"`

## Software Design


## Testing

- Unit Testing - created 
 
- Test Coverage -  is the percentage of your code covered by test suit. In laymanâ€™s language, it is the measurement of how many lines of code in your package were executed when you ran your test suit (compared to total lines in your code). Go provide built-in functionality to check your code coverage.


- Using Assertions - [Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) Go does not provide any built-in package for assertions  so i decided to use 3rd party
